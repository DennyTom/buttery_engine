[ ] Fix up README
    [ ] Removed extra code -- just use a include, it will be more readable anyway
    [ ] I don't use pyexpander anymore
    [ ] Layers
    [ ] Explain the keyboard params better

[ ] Delete the schema, seems to be wrong anyway

[ ] Fix up the engine
    [ ] Get the tests running again
    [ ] Document the code
    [ ] @Florent -- If some keys are never assigned, when hit, the keyboard will ignore the next N-1 keys (any key), where N is the max number of keys in a chord. This is solved by assigning those unused keys to KC_NO.
    [ ] @kbjunky -- Mouse issues
    [ ] @kbjunky -- there's leader_ind = 0; missing at the end of process_leader function
    [x] @supertoughfrom -- fix uint32_t instead of HASH_TYPE in a few places
    [ ] Try removing tap_timeout
    [ ] send_keyboard_report after register_code is not needed, the same for unregister_code
    [ ] Transfer from keycodes_hash to an array
    [ ] Instead of hooking into process_keycode_user(), directly read the matrix?

[ ] Make a test json

[ ] Extending the engine
    [ ] Parsing for QMK layers with the keycode expanding
    [ ] @Florent -- request for alternative KM() behavior that requires per chord timers
    [ ] Nested keycodes like KK(A, LSFT + LALT)
    [ ] Adding the option for process_user() ?
