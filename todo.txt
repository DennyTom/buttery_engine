    [ ] Layers

[ ] Delete the schema, seems to be wrong anyway

[ ] Fix up the engine
    [ ] Get the tests running again
    [ ] What is keycodes_buffer_array?

        [ ] What is this?

[ ] Make a test json



[ ] Parsing for normal layers (with the keycode expanding).
[ ] Ability to put "simple" chords into "control" chords
[ ] Ability to extend the engine
    [ ] What? How?
